        javesi is a concurrent Java entity system.
    </p>
    <p>
        It keeps track of game object identity and handles assigning components to the entities and finding entities
        by component and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each entity system has a fixed number of component types it supports. Each entity can have any of these components
        but only one for each type.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an additional component type called singleton component. A singleton component can only be applied to
        no or exactly one entity. Assigning it to another entity will make the original entity lose that component.
